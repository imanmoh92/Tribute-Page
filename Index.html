    <p class="line1">
      Abdullahi Mohamed was born on December 15, 1944 in a small town called Dhahar, Somalia.
      While working on a merchant ship, he had the oppurtunity to travel to many different countries, his favorite
      being Greece where he was fondly nicknamed "The Black Greek". On one trip Abdullahi landed in
      a New York port and ultimately decided to stay and begin a new life. He worked many odd jobs to support his family back home.
      While visting family in Somalia he met a woman named Zahra, they fell in love and decided to get married.
      Abdullahi brought her to New York, along with his two sons from a previous marriage. They settled in Brooklyn, New York,
  after a few years they welcomed their baby girl named Iman. </p>

    their youngest child, Iman, attended a private Islamic school. Abdullahi and his family
    often took road trips together, making beautiful memories along the way. His dream was
